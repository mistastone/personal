			<p>Hello! My name is Michael and I am a front-end web developer and designer based in Toronto.</p><p>I love web development because it lives at the intersection of order and creativity. My goal is to focus on both of these factors equally by creating functional technology as well as beautiful design.</p>

			<h3>Drivers Unite!</h3>
			<p>A world of possibility can open with a simple email. I sent such an email to the president of Pfaff Automotive in 2012 requesting a sit-down meeting to share our passion for cars and find out if there were any opportunities in the industry. Amazingly, this initial email would eventually lead to seat time in some of the world's most desirable sports cars, recognition on Jalopnik, the internet's leading automotive blog, and interviews with key personalities in the automotive industry such as Magnus Walker.</p><p>My aim is to take a fresh and intelligent perspective on the sports car industry and share my enthusiasm and love for driving and design. I believe that sports cars provide a visceral experience that demands high quality journalism and photography. Through my writing I hope to bring this to all readers who share my passion.</p><p>I hope that if you are not an automotive enthusiast the writing, photography, and illustrations will convert you.

	<!-- Meditation and Philosophy Boxes -->

			<div class="humanbox">
				<img src="assets/images/meditate.png" alt="Meditation">
				<p>Mindfulness meditation has shown me that a deeper reality exists beneath our typical day-to-day experience and we can access it by simply paying more attention to our minds and to our hearts. Meditation itself is not just a formal practice but a philosophy on how to deepen our connection with all aspects of life.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="humanbox">
				<img src="assets/images/light.png" alt="Philosophy">
				<p>Philosophy is the foundation for all of our behaviour. My core philosophical values include honesty, reason, hard work, and respect for others. I implement these values in all aspects of my life, from professional to social, and because of this I can be trusted to build both amazing products and solid relationships.</p>

	<!-- People and Squash Boxes -->

		<section class="humantwo">

			<div class="humanbox two">
				<img src="assets/images/friends.png" alt="People">
				<p>People are the most valuable resource available. We create opportunities for each other professionally, socially, and spiritually. I believe in forming connections with a circle of people with similar values and goals. I strive for self-awareness to improve my chances of aligning with the right people.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="humanbox two">
				<img src="assets/images/squash.png" alt="Squash">
				<p>As web development lives at the intersection of creativity and order, squash lives at the intersection of the physical and the mental. For this reason I absolutely love the game and the benefits that come with it. It also doesn't hurt to get some exercise after hours of coding. If you want to learn the game or are looking for a new partner I am a short email away!</p>
